    <!--   Steps   -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate</strong>: Begin by marinating the chicken pieces in a buttermilk bath. Allow them to soak for at least an hour, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator. This step helps tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Seasoning</strong>: Mix the paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and a hint of cayenne in a bowl. Adjust the seasoning to suit your preference for heat and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat with Seasoned Flour</strong>: In a separate bowl, combine the seasoned flour mixture. Dredge each marinated chicken piece in the flour mixture, ensuring a thorough coating. Press the flour into the chicken for an even crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil</strong>: In a heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven, heat the oil to a temperature of around 350-375째F (175-190째C). Use enough oil to submerge the chicken pieces halfway.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry to Golden Perfection</strong>: Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, skin-side down if using skin-on chicken. Fry in batches to prevent overcrowding, allowing the chicken to cook evenly and the crust to become crispy. Turn the pieces occasionally for uniform cooking until they achieve a rich, golden-brown color and reach an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C).</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve</strong>: Once done, transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil. Allow a few minutes for it to cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
